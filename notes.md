CLASS NOTES

-- GIT --
Git saves older versions of your work. First you add, putting changes on the stage, then commit, saving those changes. Checkout then brings back an older version, putting your directory back to an older state.

-- GITHUB --
Github allows you to put your work online, for everyone to access and to collaborate. Push sends your work to github, and pull brings it down.
